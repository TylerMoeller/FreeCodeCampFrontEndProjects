    Assignment Details:
      - Developed for the freeCodeCamp React Project: Build a Markdown Previewer
      - Details: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-markdown-previewer

    Requirements for this assignment:
      - Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/obYYqW.
      - Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
      - Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
      - Rule #3: You must use both Sass and React to build this project.
      - User Story: I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.
      - User Story: I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.
      - Hint: You don't need to interpret Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked

    Assignment Completed. v1.0 03/28/2016:
      - Responsive design using HTML5, Font-Awesome, Sass, and React with JSX syntax
      - All required user stories fulfilled.
